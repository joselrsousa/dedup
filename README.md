# Dedup
Identifying deduplication using apache pig.
## Introduction
Today genetics data analysis represents a huge challenge on the analytics capability to process the data due to its individual file size. The capability of deduping as a formal approach to verify the quality of a file faces that challenge. Normally the approach would be to rely on high performance computing to do it. Here we describe an approach of doing dedup applied to genetic data and used in the paper by Aideen et al (2019) by using containers possible to be executed on "normal" computers and with timelines fairly aceptable.
